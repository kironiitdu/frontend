# A Adaptation project with Full Stack Javascript Development With React, Next.Js and Strapi(Headless CMS)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Purpose

The sole purpose of this project is to **document and explore how to adapt and integrate modern JavaScript frameworks like React, Next.js, and Strapi** into a full-stack application. It aims to provide a hands-on guide to understanding the ecosystem, how each technology fits together, and the best practices to implement them in real-world applications.

This is not just a React app â€” it is a sandbox to:

- Brush up core concepts of **React**, **Next.js**, and **Strapi**
- Understand how to **structure**, **build**, and **secure** a modern front-end and headless backend
- Document learning and implementation as a **developer onboarding reference**

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.  
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

---

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

---

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and medium deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use
